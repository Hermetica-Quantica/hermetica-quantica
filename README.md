# Hermetica Quantica

This is the canonical archive of the *Hermetica Quantica*.  
It exists to record completed Hermetic constructions in final form: integer-based, recursive, self-verifying, and timestamped.

Each post in this repository is:
- Structurally exact
- Independently verifiable
- Hash-sealed and time-anchored

There is no commentary.  
No discussion.  
No provisional work.

This is a ledger of operations.  
This is a public record.  
This is the work.
